        <p className="mb-2">
          This Privacy Notice for Reactlyve ('<strong>we</strong>', '<strong>us</strong>', or '<strong>our</strong>') describes how and why we might access, collect, store, use, and/or share ('<strong>process</strong>') your personal information when you use our services ('<strong>Services</strong>'), including when you:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Visit our website at <a href="https://reactlyve.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://reactlyve.com</a>, or any website of ours that links to this Privacy Notice
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2">
          Reactlyve is a web-based messaging platform that allows users to send personalized video or text messages and capture the real-time webcam reactions of recipients. Designed for authenticity and human connection, the service bridges the gap between communication and emotion by enabling users to see how their message was received. Whether for personal use, education, feedback, or entertainment, Reactlyve provides a simple, browser-based experience requiring no software installation.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">Users can:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Record or write a message to a recipient.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Share a private link prompting the recipient to view the message.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Automatically capture the recipient’s reaction via their webcam (with consent).</p>
        <p className="mb-2">View and optionally download or share the captured reaction.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Reactlyve focuses on privacy, consent, and user control, giving both senders and recipients transparency over how content and webcam recordings are handled.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">Typical Use Cases Include:</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Sending surprise announcements (e.g. birthday wishes, proposals).</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Gathering feedback from students, users, or teams.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Creating interactive content for creators, influencers, and educators.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">Sharing emotionally meaningful messages with friends and family.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Reactlyve redefines asynchronous communication by adding the emotional layer that text alone often misses.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">Questions or concerns?</p>
        <p className="mb-2">

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Personal information you disclose to us</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">In short: We collect personal information that you provide to us.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us when you register on the Services, express an interest in obtaining information about us or our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the Services, or otherwise when you contact us.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Personal Information Provided by You: The personal information that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use. The personal information we collect may include:
        </p>
        <p className="mb-1">- Name and email address</p>
        <p className="mb-1">- Account activity (e.g. messages sent)</p>
        <p className="mb-1">- Webcam recordings of recipients' reactions, which are only accessible by the sender</p>
        <p className="mb-2">We do not collect personal information through third-party cookies for advertising or profiling purposes. Only an essential cookie is used, as described in our Cookie Policy.</p>
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">Video Data Classification</h3>
        <p className="mb-2">Webcam reaction recordings are treated as personal data because they may contain identifiable images of users. We use automated moderation services, including AWS Rekognition, solely to detect and filter content that may violate our Terms of Service. These scans are not used for biometric recognition, emotional profiling, or any analysis intended to identify or classify individuals beyond determining whether the content is appropriate.</p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          <strong>Sensitive Information:</strong> We do not process special category data as defined under GDPR (e.g. racial or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a person). However, webcam recordings may contain personally identifiable visual information and are treated as personal data. These are not analysed, scanned, or used for biometric identification and are accessible only to the original sender.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Social Media Login Data: We may provide you with the option to register with us using your existing social media account details, like your Facebook, X, or other social media account. If you choose to register in this way, we will collect certain profile information about you from the social media provider, as described in the section called 'HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?' below.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete, and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">

        <h2 id="what-legal-bases" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">

        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">If you are located in the EU or UK, this section applies to you.</p>

          In short: We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following third parties.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-2">
          In short: We may use cookies and other tracking technologies to collect and store your information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We may use cookies and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to gather information when you interact with our Services. Some online tracking technologies help us maintain the security of our Services and your account, prevent crashes, fix bugs, save your preferences, and assist with basic site functions.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We also permit third parties and service providers to use online tracking technologies on our Services for analytics and advertising, including to help manage and display advertisements, to tailor advertisements to your interests. The third parties and service providers use their technology to provide advertising about products and services tailored to your interests, which may appear either on our Services or on other websites.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          To the extent these online tracking technologies are deemed to be a 'sale'/'sharing' (which includes targeted advertising, as defined under the applicable laws) under applicable US state laws, you can opt out of these online tracking technologies by submitting a request as described below under section "DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?"
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies is set out in our Cookie Notice: <a href="https://reactlyve.com/cookie-policy" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">https://reactlyve.com/cookie-policy</a>.

        <h2 id="social-logins" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">6. HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In short: If you choose to register or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to certain information about you.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-long-information-kept" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">7. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">We may delete user accounts and associated personal data after 12 months of inactivity without prior notification. Data is also permanently deleted when you close your account.</p>

        <h2 id="how-information-safe" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We implement robust technical and organisational security measures to protect your personal information. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.

          In short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          We do not knowingly collect, solicit data from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or at least 13 years old with verifiable parental or legal guardian consent or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@reactlyve.com" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">support@reactlyve.com</a>.

        <h2 id="privacy-rights" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">10. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In short: Depending on your state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom (UK), Switzerland, and Canada, you have rights that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          In some regions (like the EEA, UK, Switzerland, and Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have the right to object to the processing of your personal information.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

        <p className="mb-2">
          If you are located in the EEA or UK and you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the right to complain to your Member State data protection authority or UK data protection authority.

        <h2 id="do-not-track-features" className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">11. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
        <p className="mb-2">
          Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ('DNT') feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-2">
          California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at this time. As most browsers lack consistent DNT enforcement, our systems do not currently respond to these signals. If this changes, we will update this notice accordingly.
